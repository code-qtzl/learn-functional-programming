# What is Functional Programming

-   [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is more about declaring what you want to happen, rather than how you want it to happen.

-   [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) (or procedural) programming declares both the what and the how.
